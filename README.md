# Motive
Having worked at 3 companies(until 2021.11), I now realize one thing becomes important: tools by hand.

Tools existed, but not well grouped.A toolset can be iteratively developed so that it keeps update with its up-or-down stream.

This toolset per company, per team, even per developer, requires a well detailed description about its internal design, to ensure its goal is well reached.

So, let's start!

# Overview

# Quickstart
`t.zero` is short for `test platform.0`, we can start from it to get a basic feeling of what a **test-platform** looks like.

1. clone this repository
```bash
mkdir projects
cd projects
git clone https://github.com/xhd2015/test-platform
cd test-platform
```

2. start `t.zero`
```bash
cd t.zero
npm run serve
```

3. open the page
```bash
open http://localhost:8080
```

# Next
Check code of [t.zero](./t.zero)
